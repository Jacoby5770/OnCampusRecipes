# OnCampusRecipes

After interviewing a few college students and reflecting on my own experiences cooking on campus, there was a unanymous agreement that many students know only a couple of recipes off hand. Many times, students will have to filter through Google searches and look recipes up online, or ask friends and family to assist with their cooking over the phone. Students expressed frustration over the ways in which this inconvenienced their friends/family and caused them to constantly overspend on groceries/eating out and lacked the resources to create more nutritional meals.

OnCampusRecipe is a text messaging app that provides users with a convenient and comprehensive repertoire of recipes, allowing users to shop smarter and eat healthier. This app was designed for college students who are tired of making the same meals over and over again, and are looking for fast and easy ways to discover new recipes they can prepare. OnCampusRecipe mitigates the inconvenience of filtering through google searches and having to bother friends/family by suggesting new recipes through URLs that lead users directly to new recipes. 

Unique to other recipe generating webistes and apps, OnCampusRecipe also allows users to tailor the profile of the meal they will be cooking based on available ingredients and desired cuisine. Users are able to do this by sending a text to the app including a list of ingredients that are available and a desired cuisine. OnCampusRecipe will then provide options based on those filters to provide users with the most desirable meal. Additionally, users are able to add their favorite recipes into the generator with their respective attributes, such as price, nutrition and key ingrediants.

# Answers:

## Question 1: 
1. 6x per week
2. 2-3x per week

and decorate cakes about once a week, and I mix drinks two or three times a week.

## Question 2: 
1. 5 recipes
2. 7 recipes
3. There are a couple dozen cocktails I know how to make offhand, along with a few different

remember the proportions correctly

## Question 3: 
1. about 3x per week
2. 1-2x per week

good campus dining available (weekends, late night) or as a social function with friends.

## Question 4:

3. I typically eat out for meals when campus dining isn’t available, since I don’t have cooking

my suite much more enjoyable (and way cheaper) than going out to bars.
