# Answers:

## Question 1: 
1. 6x per week
2. 2-3x per week
3. I rarely prepare meals for myself (since I’m required to be on a 14 meal plan), but I bake
and decorate cakes about once a week, and I mix drinks two or three times a week.

## Question 2: 
1. 7 recipes
2. 12 recipes
3. There are a couple dozen cocktails I know how to make offhand, along with a few different
kinds of frosting. For baked goods, I look up recipes every time because I can never
remember the proportions correctly

## Question 3: 
1. about 3x per week
2. 1-2x per week
3. I wouldn’t say I ever go out because I run out of recipes. I go eat out when there’s no
good campus dining available (weekends, late night) or as a social function with friends.

## Question 4: 
1. cook
2. Prefer to eat out
3. I typically eat out for meals when campus dining isn’t available, since I don’t have cooking
supplies or convenient access to fresh ingredients. However, I definitely prefer homemade
drinks and desserts. I find sharing a drink with friends in the relaxed setting of
my suite much more enjoyable (and way cheaper) than going out to bars.

## Question 8:
